# ZS042 blue large PCB model DS3231 RTC Real Time Clock Module
This board is typically used as an RTC Real Time Clock. It can also be used as an accurate RTC external 32Khz oscillator for the ESP32.

Contains 1x chip Maxim Integrated "DS3231SN I2C-Integrated RTC/TCXO/Crystal" (the biggest chip on the PCB) in package SOIC16.



## Example ESP-IDF project

`my_ds3231_clock_using_lib` This project demonstrates the basics of using the MJD component "mjd_ds3231" for the DS3231-based RTC Real Time Clock boards.

`esp32_ds3231_32khz_oscillator_using_lib` This project demonstrates the hardware and software setup how to use a DS3231 as an external 32KHz external oscillator for the ESP32 (and get accurate timings in deep sleep).

## Board PIN layout
```
1 32K : only used when the board is used as an external crystal oscillator
2 SQW : not used
3 SCL : I2C Clock signal
4 SDA : I2C Data signal
5 VCC : 3.3V
6 GND : Ground
```

## Remove resistors to reduce current consumption and make the module safer
- Remove the charging circuit resistor and the power LED resistor from the circuit board. Open the image "ZS042 DS3231 RTC Real Time Clock -  Remove these 2 resistors.jpg" in the "_doc" directory for the exact location of these resistors on the board.

### Wiring instructions for using the I2C protocol
- Connect RTC board pin VCC to the MCU pin VCC 3V.
- Connect RTC board pin GND to the MCU pin GND.
- Connect RTC board pin SCL to a MCU GPIO#21 (Huzzah32 #21 bottomleft).
- Connect RTC board pin SDA to a MCU GPIO#17 (Huzzah32 #17 bottomleft-1).



## Sensor I2C
- I2C Device address 0x68 = the RTC Maxim Integrated DS3231.
- I2C Device address 0x57 = the EEPROM Atmel 24C324. This chip is not used directly. The A0, A1 and A2 pads (open by default) are used for changing the I2C address of the EEPROM memory chip. It is OK to leave the pads open. I have no information how these pads affect the I2C address.

- Sensor acts as a slave.

## FAQ

- OK 3.3V - 5V.
- The battery holder is designed for a CR2032 Lithium battery (non rechargeable!).
- RTC Accuracy: 1 second.
- The contents of the time and calendar registers are in *the binary-coded decimal (BCD) format*.
- The board contains the required pull-up resistors when using the I2C protocol. This includes the I2C bus pins and the 32K and SQW pins.
- The DS3231 can be run in either 12-hour or 24-hour mode. Bit 6 of the hours register is defined as the 12- or 24-hour mode select bit.
     When high, the 12-hour mode is selected, and bit 5 is the AM/PM bit with logic-high being PM.
     ***When low,  the 24-hour mode is selected***, and bit 5 is the 20-hour bit (20â€“23 hours).
- The IC contains **a digital temperature sensor**. Accuracy: +-3degrees Celsius. The temperature reading (Celsius) of the on-board temperature sensor is exposed via the I2C protocol. This is handy for having for example a temperature reading of the PCB inside a project box.

- Contains also 1x EEPROM 24C342 memory chip from Atmel (the smallest chip on the PCB) which is not used. http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/en010361



## Important: use CR2032 3V non-rechargeable Lithium Batteries and disable the battery charging circuit
- The DS3231 RTC and the 24C32 EEPROM chips do nothing to manage the charging of the battery.
- The ZS-042 board's additional battery charging circuit does not work when using a 3.3V microcontroller board; the charging circuit will only waste power. The circuit is also unsafe when using a 5V microcontroller board in combination with LIR2032 batteries.
- So only use CR2032 3V non-rechargeable Lithium batteries; a CR2032 will backup the RTC for many years. Do **not** use LIR2032 3.6V Li-Ion Rechargeable batteries because a) the battery will not charge at all; b) they cost significantly more than standard C2032 batteries.



## Known Issues
- The battery charger circuit does not work for 3.3V microcontrollers and LIR2032 batteries.
